# Use Cases for Widgets

Widgets empower developers to efficiently manage complex and dynamic user interfaces across diverse applications. Below are key scenarios showcasing how Widgets simplify interface management and enhance responsiveness.

## Creating Dynamic Dashboards

Imagine needing to display a customizable dashboard tailored for various user roles, such as administrators, analysts, and end-users. Each role requires a distinct set of widgets and data visualizations relevant to their specific tasks.

Widget Definitions simplify this process by creating reusable templates:
`
{
  "name": "analytics_overview",
  "properties": {
    "refreshInterval": { "type": "numeric", "defaultValue": 60 },
    "dataSource": { "type": "text", "defaultValue": "sales_data" }
  }
}
`
With these definitions in place, you can rapidly deploy dashboards, customizing the widgets with role-specific properties and datasets, significantly reducing the setup time.

## Real-Time Interface Updates

Widgets provide robust real-time capabilities, ensuring your interface remains responsive to live data feeds or events. For example, a monitoring interface might need instant updates based on sensor data.

By integrating Widgets with the Event service, you can dynamically update widget states based on event triggers, maintaining an always-accurate, real-time display.

### Example Event Integration
`
{
  "widgetId": "sensor_temperature",
  "eventTrigger": "temperature_change",
  "stateUpdate": { "temperature": "{{new_temperature}}" }
}
`
Widgets handle event-driven state changes smoothly, ensuring your interface reflects current conditions immediately.

## State Management for User Interactions

User interactions often require widgets to reflect different statesâ€”active, inactive, error, or loading. Managing these states manually can become cumbersome, especially as your application grows.

Widgets simplify this by defining clear states, which can be programmatically managed:
`
{
  "widgetId": "submit_button",
  "state": "disabled",
  "interactions": {
    "clickable": false,
    "tooltip": "Processing your request..."
  }
}
`
Managing widget states ensures users receive clear visual feedback, improving usability and reducing confusion.

## Preparing for Contingency Scenarios

Unexpected events, such as data outages or sudden load increases, require immediate and clear interface responses to maintain user confidence.

### Pre-requisites

Ensure multiple Widget Layouts have been prepared for different scenarios, including contingency situations.

### Solution

1. Prepare multiple Widget Layouts in advance, each optimized for specific conditions:

2. Normal Operations: Standard layout displaying full widget sets.

3. High-Load Mode: Simplified layout showing only essential widgets to maintain performance.

4. Data-Outage Mode: Layout clearly communicating service disruptions, using static informational widgets.

During runtime:

* Monitor events or conditions through integration with the Event service.

* Automatically switch layouts based on real-time status changes.

This proactive approach maintains clarity and functionality under varied operational scenarios, enhancing overall system resilience.
