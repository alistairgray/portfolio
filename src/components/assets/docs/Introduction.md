# Widgets Introduction

Managing dynamic and adaptable user interfaces can be challenging, particularly when widget definitions become intertwined with application logic. Typically, widget configurations remain static, making adjustments cumbersome when real-time scenarios demand flexibility and responsiveness.

The Widgets service introduces robust adaptability with reusable components and configurable layouts. It simplifies interface creation, provides fine-grained control over widget interactions, and seamlessly integrates with diverse data sources and platforms.

## Benefits

* Prepare in advance for dynamic interface scenarios (e.g., different user roles or deliveries)

* Gain precise control over widget behavior and layout

* Implement custom interaction logic

* Easily integrates with any data source or platform

## Features/Functions

### Model your widgets

The Widgets service allows you to create templates for standard widgets used in your applications.

Widget templates enable you to define the structure, appearance, and interactions of widgets independently from your applicationâ€™s core logic.

These templates significantly streamline your interface development process. Rather than crafting widgets repeatedly, you simply define them once and reuse them across current and future interfaces.

### How Widget Templates work

For each Widget Templte, you specify its properties, default values, and behaviors. When instantiating a widget, you apply the definition, filling in or overriding default properties as needed.



### Create configurable Widget Layouts

Widget Layouts allow you to organize and group widgets to build coherent and responsive interfaces tailored to different contexts.



### Adapt to multiple interface scenarios

Prepare multiple layouts for various scenarios, such as administrative dashboards, user profiles, or situational monitoring interfaces. This flexibility helps you swiftly respond to changing requirements or roles.

### Divide Widget Layouts into sections

Efficiently organize complex interfaces by dividing them into manageable sections, such as an overview area, detailed data views, and interactive controls. These segments improve user experience and clarity.

### Fine control

Widgets service provides intuitive tools to rearrange widgets within layouts or transfer widgets between different layouts, ensuring optimal organization and user accessibility.

For example, create layouts for:

* Dashboard overview

* Real-time data monitoring

* User management

Then combine them into unified views tailored to specific user interactions or workflow stages.



### Integrate Widgets seamlessly with data sources

The Widgets service integrates effortlessly with various data services, ensuring real-time synchronization and accurate representation of data. Visit here to learn more about data source integration.

The service acts as a central interface hub, managing data exchange between widgets and backend services or external platforms, ensuring smooth and reliable interactions.

### Custom state and interaction management

Widgets provides powerful capabilities for managing widget states and user interactions. Define custom states and interactions, such as enabled, disabled, active, or error conditions, tailored specifically to your operational workflow and user requirements.

### Native Integration with Platform services

Thanks to Widgets' open architectural design, the service natively connects to its other services, such as the Widget-Hub and Delivery services. This also means that your own external services can connect with a simple API call.

#### Integration with Widget-Hub service

Widgets natively connects with your Widget-Hub services through built-in connectors, simplifying data synchronization, updates, and interaction management. This streamlined integration ensures efficient data-driven user interfaces.

#### Integration with Delivery service

Widgets also integrates with the Delivery service, allowing your interfaces to dynamically respond to real-time events or triggers. This ensures your widgets stay interactive, relevant, and contextually responsive to user needs and operational events.
