                                We need to stop trying to find people to fit a role by a list of requirements and obtuse technical tests. It's this pursuit that is strangling our ability to find people at the detriment of the candidates and the people both critiquing and advocating for them.</p>

                                Rather, we need to believe that we are custodians for the next generation of talent, whether it be in our own companies or our competitors. If we change the conversation away from a competition for the next hire and rather focus on a greater goal, I am certain we will start to see the challenges of recruitment fade away.

                            For you to get the most out of this tool, I recommend finding a space where you can write and draw. It can be something physical, such as an A4 sized sheet, on a whiteboard or utilising post-it notes. Alternatively, you could use something like the free software available such as Miro or MS Paint. As long as it is easy to use and offers a large space, you will be fine.

                             In my example I have kept things simple. The four areas reflect where my mind is today along with a direction of where I want to grow next. It also really helps to focus on the why, what and how behind your areas of growth. Why do you want to pursue this area? What will it give you? And how are you seeking to accomplish it? If these questions are hard to answer, then take this opportunity to reconsider your areas of growth.

                            <p>As the morning began, the light from the sun peeked through the ceiling and drifted across 
                                The Marchioness’s eyes. She began to awake, rather slowly, and peered up at the ceiling. There appeared to be a collection of iridescent crystals, each one carrying the light from the sun outside, illuminating the surroundings. Silvae was beside his makeshift workshop staring at its surface, deeply in thought.

                                He looked towards Tally and spoke with a quiet intensity, “When I was young, I as others like me, took an oath. My oath to the forest is to protect you, and others like you, to ensure a safe passage. We cannot go to The Court.” Silvae motioned towards The Marchioness’s head. “That wound was not from a fall but by a Triactural Scar. Its mark is distinct.” ...</p>
