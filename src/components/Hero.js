                    I have had a weirdly diverse career stretching over 15 years and 7 industries, I always try to leverage my experience to find the simplicity out of complexity.

                    I published a book in 2020, called Finding Your Fire Within a Burning World.

These have been crucial to navigating my career and journey through life.
